				<h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>

				<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

				<p>
					In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice
					that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just
					remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages
					that you’ve had.”
				</p>
				<p>
					He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative
					in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more
					than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a
					habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me
					the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
					detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal
					person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
					being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,
					unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have
					feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by
					some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on
					the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least
					the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and
					marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of
					infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I
					forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly
					repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out
					unequally at birth.
				</p>
				<p>
					And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission
					that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the
					wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded
					on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted
					the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I
					wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the
					human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was
					exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which
					I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of
					successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some
					heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related
					to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten
					thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that
					flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the
					“creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a
					romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and
					which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out
					all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust
					floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my
					interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
